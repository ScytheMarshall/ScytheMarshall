I'm ScytheMarshall. Hello! I'm a mathematician but also an amateur programmer.
- Right now I'm mostly interested in... well, finding employment, I suppose.
- But also! I'm working on a fork of [FF4: Free Enterprise](https://github.com/HungryTenor/FreeEnterprise4). The goal is to not only add my own work, but also incorporate as many changes from others as possible, to make a "Bad Ideas" fork. It'll be great! And I'll learn lots of Python as I go.

Other important information:
- You can reach me on Discord as `scythemarshall`.
- Pronouns: he/him
